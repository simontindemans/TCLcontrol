# TCLcontrol
Decentralised distribution-referred TCL controller

This code accompanies the paper *Low-complexity algorithm for decentralized aggregate load control of thermostatic loads*,
to appear in IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications.

If you use (parts of) this code, please cite the published paper.

## Organization
Code is available in the directory `/code`. The Jupyter notebook `TCLcontrol_notebook.ipynb` reproduces all figures from the paper. These are available in `/results`.

## Dependencies
This code requires installation of the following libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `numba`, `matplotlib` and `statsmodels`. Only `numba` is required for the controller module.
